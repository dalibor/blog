First half of this year has been quite busy 'till now! 

I went to 4 [NSND](http://www.nsnd.org/ "NSND") events ( [Kumanovo](http://wiki.spodeli.org/NSND/2012/%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE "NSND Kumanovo"), [Shtip](http://wiki.spodeli.org/NSND/2012/%D0%A8%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BF "NSND Shtip"), [Belgrade](http://www.nsnd.org/2012/04/10/nsnd-beograd-4-guzvanje-u-pink-kuhinji/ "NSND Belgrade") and [Struga](http://wiki.spodeli.org/NSND/2012/Ohrid "NSND Struga")). I went to [Cape Town](http://instagram.com/p/LIfcA9gXHF/ "Cape Town - Table Mountain") to meet my company team and had some great time there. I got new laptop: [Thinkpad T530](http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/thinkpad/t-series/t530/ "Thinkpad T530"), released new version of [PopraviMK](http://popravi.mk/ "PopraviMK") mobile and saw [Exodus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKs1ctp91FI "Exodus") live in Skopje. :)

I published a new blog post on the [GoDaddy Open Source Blog](https://godaddy.github.io) that talks about migrating from OS based cron jobs to distributed cron jobs using Sidekiq Scheduler.

> One such plugin that helped us run distributed cron, reduce maintenance costs and simplify our deployments is [Sidekiq Scheduler](https://github.com/moove-it/sidekiq-scheduler). We will discuss the motivation for migrating from OS based cron to distributed cron using Sidekiq Scheduler and the benefits we get from it.

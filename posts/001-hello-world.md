Hello everyone! I'm Dalibor and this is my blog. It's a simple Ruby on Rails application that you can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/dalibor/dalibornasevic.com "Dalibor Nasevic blog").

Besides the fact that I can customize it, the reason for building something from scratch is the experience I get by maintaining it live. It's a playground to experiment, learn TDD, go through Rails version upgrades, configure VPS, web servers, deployment process and all the fun stuff.

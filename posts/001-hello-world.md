Hello everyone! This is my technical blog. It's a Ruby on Rails web application that you can find the source code on my [Github](https://github.com/dalibor/dalibornasevic.com "My blog") account.

I tried out few blogging platforms but none was too exciting. Sometimes it's more fun to build your own thing and have full control over both development and deployment. It's a good learning exercise and a playground for improving your TDD skills, learn how to setup new VPS box, configure web server and go through the deployment process. I'll share some of my experiences with it here.

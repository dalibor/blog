The 4 Agile [values](http://agilemanifesto.org/ "Agile values") are:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

The 12 Agile [principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html "Agile principles") are:

- Early and continues delivery
- Welcome changing requirements
- Deliver working software frequently
- Business people and developers work together
- Motivated individuals
- Face-to-face conversation
- Working software
- Sustainable development
- Technical excellence
- Simplicity
- Self-organizing teams
- Reflection

Getting sense about the values and principles is easy, but the reality and the process of transforming to an agile team is a long journey. There are few [methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process) that contribute with different ideas on that path and what I like most is the strong focus of eXtreme Programming on the engineering practices and delivering high-quality software quickly and continuously with the management overhead set to minimum.

Agile [values](http://agilemanifesto.org/ "Agile values") and [principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html "Agile principles") are:

- Individuals & Interactions
- Working Software
- Customer Collaboration
- Responding to Change
- Early and Continues Delivery
- Welcoming Changing Requirements
- Business People and Developers Work Together
- Motivated Individuals
- Face-to-Face Conversation
- Sustainable Development
- Technical Excellence
- Simplicity
- Self-Organized Teams
- Reflection

Understanding these values and principles is easy, but implementing Agile in an organization is difficult. There are few [methodologies](http://www.agilesherpa.org/intro_to_agile/agile_methodologies/) to help out in the process, and the one I feel strong about is eXtreme Programming (XP). It focuses on delivering high-quality software quickly and continuously with the management overhead set to minimum.

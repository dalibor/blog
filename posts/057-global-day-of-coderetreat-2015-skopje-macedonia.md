We're glad to be celebrating the Global Day of Coderetreat in Macedonia for the fifth time!

Coderetreat is a day long event of practicing software design and having fun. This year's event will take place on 14th of November 2015 at [Endava](http://www.endava.com/) offices in Skopje, who are also our sponsors this year.

For more information and registration go to the following link:

The event is open and free to participate. You only need to come up with your laptop and enthusiasm to spend the day with other developers in understanding and applying the [4 rules of simple design](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules). We focus on learning and sharing without the daily work pressure that something must be done in the end.

Coderetreat can be quite powerful and inspirational for developers. I still remember the joy of a developer from the very first Coderetreat I facilitated in [2011](http://dalibornasevic.com/posts/31-global-day-of-coderetreat-in-skopje-macedonia) when he was introduced to [TDD](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment) and the idea of programming by [wishful thinking](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WishfulThinking). On Coderetreats lots of these ideas circle around and it's very insightful to see how others think and approach problems during the pairing sessions.

It's about that time of the year again. Global Day of Coderetreat is getting close. Skopje is keeping up with the tradition and will be on the [global map](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/) again like the [years before](/posts?tag=coderetreat) since the beginning in 2011.

[Bojan](https://twitter.com/bojanv91) and [HASELT](http://haselt.com/) will be hosting the event this year. It's really nice when participants from past events bring the event to their company. That's been hapening for the past few years with the GDCR event in Skopje which is great.

I'll be facilitating the event once again. I'm looking forward for another day of exploring, learning and sharing with the software craftsmanship community.

Registration for the event is open on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-day-of-coderetreat-2016-skopje-macedonia-tickets-28188976989). Join us for an exciting day practicing software design!

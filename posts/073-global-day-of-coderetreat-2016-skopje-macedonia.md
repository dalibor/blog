It's about that time of the year again. Global Day of Coderetreat is getting close. Skopje is keeping up with the tradition and is on the [global map](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/), like the [previous years](/posts?tag=coderetreat) since the beginning in 2011.

[Bojan](https://twitter.com/bojanv91) and [HASELT](http://haselt.com/) will be hosting the event this year. It's really nice when participants from previous years take the organization and host the event in their company. That is hapening few years with the GDCR event in Skopje which is quite cool.

I'll be facilitating this year once again. I'm looking forward for another day of exploring, learning and sharing with the software craftsmanship community.

Registration for the event is open on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-day-of-coderetreat-2016-skopje-macedonia-tickets-28188976989). Join us for an exciting day practicing software design!

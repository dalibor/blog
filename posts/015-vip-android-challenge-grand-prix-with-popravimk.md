[PopraviMK](http://popravi.mk "PopraviMK official site") is a public service for reporting local problems. I build a Ruby on Rails web service and mobile application for Android platform using the Titanium mobile framework.

People can use both applications to report problems they have found on public area and institutions can respond to their requests and solve the problems.

Will institutions do that? That's the question we are trying to answer in the next period. We are preparing a presentation for the municipalities and how they can get involved and play an active role into the system.

We were two members in the team working on the development of this service. I did all the programming stuff and Dime Pashoski worked on the design.

[Titanium mobile](http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/ "Titanium Framework") is a framework for developing mobile applications. I had no previous experience with it and this was an interesting experiment. Titanium Framework gave me the power and speed to develop a mobile application in a short time with Javascript. It's still in a very active development and its version for iPhone seems to be much more stable than the Android one. That means, the development process of the Android application wasn't very pleasant, although I would say that it's far more pleasant than writing it in Java. :)

I will write more technical posts about the Titanium framework in future.

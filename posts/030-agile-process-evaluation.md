We all understand Agile [values](http://agilemanifesto.org/ "Agile values") and [principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html "Agile principles"):

- Individuals & Interactions
- Working Software
- Customer Collaboration
- Responding to Change
- Early and Continues Delivery
- Welcoming Changing Requirements
- Business People and Developers Work Together
- Motivated Individuals
- Face-to-Face Conversation
- Sustainable Development
- Technical Excellence
- Simplicity
- Self-Organized Teams
- Reflection

Understanding Agile is very easy, but implementing an Agile process is difficult.

If you are doing Scrum, you can check out the Nokia [Scrum but Test](http://jeffsutherland.com/nokiatest.pdf "Nokia Scrum but Test") and see if you are really doing Scrum or skipping some practices (Scrum but). You can also test your score [here](http://antoine.vernois.net/scrumbut/?page=test&lang=en "Nokia Scrum but Test Score") and see at what level your Agile/Scrum process is.

Raising the score will increase the velocity and quality, and that's what we want from our process, right?
